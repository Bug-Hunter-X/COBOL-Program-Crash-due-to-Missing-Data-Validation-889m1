This repository contains a COBOL program that demonstrates an uncommon error: a program crash due to missing data validation. The program reads customer records from a file and calculates the total amount. The program lacks validation for the WS-AMOUNT field, resulting in a crash if the input file contains non-numeric data.  The solution demonstrates how to add data validation to prevent this error.  A thorough testing plan should always include boundary condition and invalid data tests to detect such errors early.
